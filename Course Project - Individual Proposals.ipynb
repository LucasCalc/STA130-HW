    "# Individual Proposals\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposal 1 - Priority of Social Interaction vs Mental Health\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables:\n",
    "#### Dependent Variable - Priority Score (2022 Cross Sectional, lines 1132-1144)\n",
    "The dependent variable will be a score determined by how the individual prioritizes social interaction among the other aspects of their life. This will be done using the variables from lines 1132-1144, for which the individual had to score 13 aspects of their life. Of these 13 life aspects, 4 of them involve social interaction, namely:\n",
    "- LIFESTYLE_time_use_priorities_family_time_actual\n",
    "- LIFESTYLE_time_use_priorities_friends_actual\n",
    "- LIFESTYLE_time_use_priorities_others_actual\n",
    "- LIFESTYLE_time_use_priorities_volunteering_actual\n",
    "#### Independent Variable - WELLNESS_self_rated_mental_health (2022 Cross Sectional, line 597)\n",
    "The independent variable will be the individual's own rating of their mental health.\n",
    "\n",
    "Values: 'Poor' 'Fair' 'Very good' 'Good'  'Excellent'\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "The idea of the analysis is to analyze the extent to which an individual prioritizes social interaction against their mental health. When performing the analysis, the dependent variable will be a score determined by how the individual prioritizes their social interactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the survey, the individual ranked the 13 different variables that represent aspects of their life based on their priority. For each of the 4 social aspects, the individual will be assigned points, relative to the social aspect's placements. The other 9 variables will NOT count towards the points. \n",
    "\n",
    "The points will be calculated by the equation \"14 - rank\". For example, if \"LIFESTYLE_time_use_priorities_family_time_actual\" is their number 1 priority, they will earn 13 points, however if they rank it at 13, they will only receive 1 point. Their score will be the sum of points between the 4 social aspects, and will therefore measure how strongly they prioritize social interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these individual's scores, these are some potential analysis that could be performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Descriptive Statistics**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Summarize the data by calculating key metrics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and range.\n",
    "- Group individuals into high, medium, and low categories based on their social priority scores, then compare self-rated mental health across these groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Correlation Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assess the relationship between social interaction priority scores and self-rated mental health by calculating the correlation coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Regression Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use simple linear regression to model self-rated mental health as a function of social interaction priority scores. This approach will help determine if a statistically significant link exists and quantify the expected change in mental health ratings with variations in priority scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Variance Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Segment individuals based on self-rated mental health levels (such as low, medium, high) and evaluate whether there are significant differences in social interaction priority scores across these groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Analysis of Ranking Patterns**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify patterns in social priorities, such as whether individuals who highly prioritize family also tend to prioritize friendships. Examine how these patterns may relate to mental health.\n",
    "- Create a heatmap to display the distribution of rankings across four social interaction dimensions for individuals with different mental health ratings, highlighting any common trends associated with higher or lower mental health scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Interpretation and Practical Implications**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Focus on the practical impact of the relationship between social prioritization and mental health, rather than only its statistical significance. For instance, evaluate whether a 1-point rise in social priority score meaningfully influences mental health.\n",
    "- If a notable relationship is found, consider potential applications, such as strategies that promote balanced social engagement as a means to improve mental health outcomes.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Potential Findings and Relevance\n",
    "My hypothesis is that prioritizing social interaction has a positive correlation to mental health.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis would be very interesting as I believe that individual priorities are a prominent thing in our lives. Aside from the absolute quantity of time spent in social settings, it is also important to analyze how that time spent compares to that of the other aspects of life. I feel that this is an interesting perspective when approaching the Course Project objective of analyzing the importance of social interaction in maintaining strong mental health. \n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis could yield inconclusive results, in which there is no correlation. However, the expected and intended correlation would be that those who prioritize spending time with family, friends, others, and in volunteer settings would have stronger mental health. The opposite is also technically possible\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposal 2 - The Use of Social Media During COVID-19\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "#### Dependent Variable - CONNECTION_social_media_time_per_day (2021 Cross Sectional, line 170)\n",
    "The dependent variable will be the individual's measure of their total time spent on social media.\n",
    "\n",
    "Values: 'Less than 10 minutes per day' '10-30 minutes per day' '31-60 minutes per day' '1-2 hours per day' '2-3 hours per day' 'More than 3 hours per day'\n",
    "#### Independent Variable - WELLNESS_self_rated_mental_health (2021 Cross Sectional, line 186)\n",
    "The independent variable will be the individual's own rating of their mental health.\n",
    "\n",
    "Values: 'Poor' 'Fair' 'Very good' 'Good'  'Excellent'\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "The goal of the analysis will be to explore any correlations between the amount of time individuals used social media and how mentally healthy they are. To do this, we could analyze the descriptive statistics of the data, create graphics, and calculate the correlation among the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "A graphic that could be useful would be a collection of box plots. For each measure of mental health, a box plot would be formed in which the x axis would be the time spent on social media, and the y axis would be the counts of individulas for the corresponding box plot. These box plots would then be compared to view the correlation of the data and trends among the data. We could also perform hypothesis testing to determine if social media use does or does not affect mental health.\n",
    "### Possible Findings and Relevance\n",
    "My hypothesis in this analysis is that high social media use has a NEGATIVE correlation with mental health, meaning as social media use increases, mental health declines. The purpose of the course project is to view the effects of social interaction on mental health, however I feel that social media does not equate to this nourishing social interaction. In fact, I would predict that social media use would have a negative effect on mental health. For this reason, I believe that it would be an interesting analysis to perform. \n",
    "\n",
    "When performing the analysis, we could find that their is a correlation, or that there is not. There is the possibility that social media has a positive effect on mental health, which would be interesting. Though social media can expose people to unrealistic standards of life, it is still a platform for social connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposal 3 - Sense of Community vs Mental Health\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "#### Dependent Variable - GEO_robinson_neighbourhood_cohesion_scale_sense_of_community (2022 Cross, line 1014)\n",
    "How strongly the individual feels a sense of community in their neighbourhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Values: 'Strongly disagree' 'Disagree' 'Agree' 'Strongly agree' \n",
    "#### Independent Variable - WELLNESS_self_rated_mental_health (2022 Cross Sectional, line 597)\n",
    "The independent variable will be the individual's own rating of their mental health.\n",
    "\n",
    "Values: 'Poor' 'Fair' 'Very good' 'Good'  'Excellent'\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "The goal of the analysis will be to explore any correlations between the how mentally healthy people are and how strongly they feel that they are a part of their neighbourhood community. To do this, we could analyze the descriptive statistics of the data, create graphics, and calculate the correlation among the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the graphic, we could construct a heat map which would show the density of the count in the different possible categories (for example, \"Agree\" and \"Excellent\"). This would show the trends among the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible Findings and Relevance\n",
    "My hypothesis for this analysis is that a stronger sense of community correlates to stronger mental health. The results will either have a correlation or not, and from there we can analyze a potential relationship between the variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the course project is to view the impact of social interaction on mental health. Feeling that you are a part of a community is a good measure of a persons social interaction, and how meaningful they beleive that those interactions are. For this reason, I believe that this dependent variable would be interesting to measure against their own ranking of their mental health. It also brings a separate perspective instead of strictly analyzing the frequency at which individuals interact with others, as a \"sense of community\" is strictly psychological. Therefore, this entire study is based on how the individual perceives themself, which makes it an interesting examination of the human mind."
